## Start Here

If you've followed a link to this repository, but are not really sure what it contains
or how to use it, head over to [Multicloud GitOps](https://validatedpatterns.io/patterns/multicloud-gitops/)
for additional context and installation instructions

## Rationale

The goal for this pattern is to:

* Use a GitOps approach to manage hybrid and multi-cloud deployments across both public and private clouds.
* Enable cross-cluster governance and application lifecycle management.
* Securely manage secrets across the deployment.

## How to use it:

* Copy the secrets:
  ```bash
  $ cp values-secret.yaml.template ~/.config/hybrid-cloud-patterns/values-secret-rhoai-pattern-demo.yaml
  ```

* Install the pattern
  ```bash
  $ ./pattern.sh make install
  ```

* If secrets are added/modified after installation, then:
  ```bash
  $ cp values-secret.yaml.template ~/.config/hybrid-cloud-patterns/values-secret-rhoai-pattern-demo.yaml
  $ ./pattern.sh make load-secrets
  ```

* If your admin user do not have access to the Cluster ArgoCD, then ensure that
  the ArgoCD object have default_policy: role:admin, or configure the specific
  group policies as needed
  ```bash
  $ oc -n openshift-gitops edit argocd  openshift-gitops
  ```
